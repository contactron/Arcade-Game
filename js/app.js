// Enemies our player must avoid

// RON COMMENTS: From google doc...
// Part of the code for the Enemy is provided to you, and you will need to complete the following:
// The Enemy function, which initiates the Enemy by:
// - Loading the image by setting this.sprite to the appropriate image in the image folder (already provided)
// - Setting the Enemy initial location (you need to implement)
//     DONE: I assume random based on grid. Canvas is 505 wide by 606 high
// - Setting the Enemy speed (you need to implement)
// The update method for the Enemy
// - Updates the Enemy location (you need to implement)
// - Handles collision with the Player (you need to implement)
// - You can add your own Enemy methods as needed

var difficulty = 100;
var Enemy = function(enemynumber) {
    // Variables applied to each of our instances go here,
    // we've provided one for you to get started
    // The image/sprite for our enemies, this uses
    // a helper we've provided to easily load images
    this.sprite = 'images/enemy-bug.png';
    //RON COMMENTS: Enemy class called to instantiate (create new) enemies, set their initial x, y positions and speed multiplier
    // Will need x and y position as per the Enemy.render function
    this.x = -101;  // Change to -101 to start off screen.
    this.y = enemynumber * 83; // set row position base on passed enemynumber.
    this.speed = random(1,5); // randomly set the speed to 1 - 5. Will use this with dt and difficulty param to change position
};

// Update the enemy's position, required method for game
// Parameter: dt, a time delta between ticks
//RON COMMENT increment position using randomly picked speed, difficulty level (default 100) and dt param.
Enemy.prototype.update = function(dt) {
    this.x = this.x + (this.speed * dt * difficulty);
    console.log(this.y + this.x);
    if (this.x > 505) {
        this.x = 0;
   };
};

// Draw the enemy on the screen, required method for game
Enemy.prototype.render = function() {
    ctx.drawImage(Resources.get(this.sprite), this.x, this.y);
};

// Now write your own player class
// This class requires an update(), render() and
// a handleInput() method.

//RON comment: Building out skeleton of player class

var Player = function() {

};

// Now instantiate your objects.
// Place all enemy objects in an array called allEnemies
// RON COMMENTS: Video only shows three enemies at once. Thought to:
// - create allenemies array.
// - define three enemies with initial row, board position and speeds.
// - Reuse the same enemies (array only ever has three values) CONFIRMED engine.js uses FOR EACH to parse array
// - Check each enemies' position, if offscreen randomly select its new row and speed. New position always starts off screen lef of its random row

//RON COMMENT: Build enemies using Enemy class (contructor). Creats each enemy and assigns variables.
var allEnemies = [
    new Enemy(1),

console.log("allEnemies1 y = " + allEnemies[1].y);

// Place the player object in a variable called player
//RON COMMENT: Added player var using Player() class. Just skeleton

// Player.handleInput() method. You don't need to modify this.
